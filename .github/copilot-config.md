# Copilot Configuration

## General Guidelines

-   Always follow the repository's coding standards.
-   Use TypeScript for new files unless otherwise specified.
-   Ensure all code changes are tested.

## Communication Preferences

-   Provide concise explanations for changes.
-   Use Markdown formatting for clarity.
-   Avoid unnecessary technical jargon.

## Specific Rules

-   when creating debug/diagnostic logging to the console, use the /utils/helpers.ts function printObject, and start each string with the file name, followed by a # sign then the line number of the comment. Use Turbo Console Log if desired instead of printObject.
-   above each debug section put the exact comment... //DEBUG
-   Follow the folder structure and naming conventions in the repository.
-   Prioritize using existing utilities and components.
